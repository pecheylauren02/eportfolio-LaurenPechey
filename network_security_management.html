							<h3 class="major">REFLECTION</h3>
							<p>Reflecting on my experience in the Network Security module Unit 1, I will utilise the
								Rolfe et al. (2001) reflective model to organise my thoughts and learning outcomes.</p>

							<h4>What?</h4>
							<p>This unit introduced me to the history of network security and how vulnerabilities have
								evolved over time.
								I learned how past breaches and threats have shaped modern security practices. We
								discussed
								the principles of best practice approaches to securing networks and systems, focusing on
								how layered
								defence and proactive management can help mitigate risks. The introduction to the Cyber
								Kill Chain
								model by Lockheed Martin (Hutchins et al., 2011) provided a structured way to analyse
								the stages of an attack
								and how each stage can be disrupted. This was linked to contemporary examples, including
								the SolarWinds
								exploit, helping me understand how theory translates to real-world breaches.</p>

							<h4>So What?</h4>
							<p>By reviewing common attacks and modern scanning and attack methods, I gained a clearer
								understanding
								of how threat actors exploit vulnerabilities. This awareness highlighted the importance
								of
								continuous monitoring and proactive defence. The best practice frameworks we discussed
								made me
								realise that network security is not static — it requires constant updates, user
								education,
								and the integration of robust tools and techniques. Analysing the Cyber Kill Chain made
								it
								easier to break down complex breaches into manageable parts, which I found helpful for
								planning
								mitigations and strengthening defences.</p>

							<h4>Now What?</h4>
							<p>Going forward, I plan to apply this knowledge by ensuring I can identify the origins of
								attacks
								and suggest realistic best practice approaches to mitigate them. I intend to use the
								Cyber Kill Chain
								model in future case studies or projects to break down and explain attacks in detail. I
								will also
								continue to keep up with new scanning tools and protection techniques, building on what
								I learned
								about modern attack methods. This unit has reinforced that staying informed and adopting
								a layered,
								proactive approach are essential for effective network security management.</p>

						<h3 class="major">UML Modelling to Support Secure System Planning</h3>
						<p>Welcome to Week 2, during which we will gain some practical skills regarding the creation of
							flow charts. These are used during the design stage of the SDLC and can be used from that
							point onwards to support communications between stakeholders.</p>

						<h3 class="major">LEARNING OUTCOMES</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Discuss the impact of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and describe the Cyber Kill
								Chain model.</li>
							<li>Apply the Cyber Kill Chain model to analyse a well-known APT, such as the SolarWinds
								exploit (Temple-Raston, 2021).</li>
							<li>Evaluate possible mitigations to prevent or reduce the impact of similar exploits.</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="more-content" style="display: none;">
							<h3 class="major">REFLECTION</h3>
							<p>Reflecting on my experience in the Network Security module Unit 2, I will use the
								Rolfe et al. (2001) reflective model to structure my learning and insights.</p>

							<h4>What?</h4>
							<p>In this unit, I revisited the Cyber Kill Chain model (Hutchins et al., 2011) and learned
								how to apply
								it to analyse a modern Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) case study — the SolarWinds
								exploit
								(Temple-Raston, 2021). This helped me understand how APTs operate through multiple
								attack stages,
								and how the Cyber Kill Chain breaks down these stages into identifiable phases. Studying
								the
								SolarWinds breach demonstrated how sophisticated and persistent modern attacks can be,
								highlighting
								the need for layered and proactive defences that address each step of an attack chain.
							</p>

							<h4>So What?</h4>
							<p>Applying the Cyber Kill Chain to a real-world example made me appreciate how theoretical
								models
								can support practical threat analysis. It also made me question the limitations of
								existing models
								when faced with increasingly complex APTs. I realised the importance of continuous
								evaluation
								of security frameworks to ensure they remain relevant. By analysing how the SolarWinds
								exploit
								was carried out and mitigated, I gained insights into the gaps that may exist in
								detection and
								response strategies, and how mitigations must adapt to evolving threats.</p>

							<h4>Now What?</h4>
							<p>Going forward, I plan to use the Cyber Kill Chain as a tool to break down attacks in
								future
								case studies and real-world scenarios. I will also stay informed about emerging APT
								techniques
								to test whether traditional models like the Cyber Kill Chain are sufficient or if new
								frameworks
								are needed. Understanding how to describe, analyse, and mitigate APTs will help me
								strengthen
								my approach to network security and ensure I consider both technical and organisational
								countermeasures. This unit reinforced that effective defence relies on combining
								practical
								models with up-to-date threat intelligence.</p>

						<h2 class="major">UNIT 3</h2>
						<h3 class="major">Programming Languages: History, Concepts & Design</h3>
						<p>Welcome to Week 3 where we will spend some time investigating programming languages – looking
							at the history, concepts, and design that led to the languages we have today. Programming
							languages are a fundamental concept in computer science – they are the primary tool used by
							computer scientists and developers to design, define, create, and implement the tools we use
							today.</p>

						<h3 class="major">LEARNING OUTCOMES</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Discuss different approaches to vulnerability testing and assessments, and select
								appropriate methods based on the target business.</li>
							<li>Utilise open-source scanning and testing tools to perform vulnerability assessments.
							</li>
							<li>Analyse assessment results and produce reports with recommendations to mitigate
								vulnerabilities.</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="more-content" style="display: none;">
							<h3 class="major">REFLECTION</h3>
							<p>Reflecting on my experience in Unit 3 of the Network Security module, I will use the
								Rolfe et al. (2001)
								reflective model to structure my thoughts, with a focus on the Vulnerability Audit and
								Assessment for the
								Gin and Juice website.</p>

							<h4>What?</h4>
							<p>In this unit, I explored different approaches to vulnerability assessments, including
								Cyber Essentials,
								general vulnerability scans, and more advanced certified penetration tests. The
								lecturecast and readings
								gave me a clear framework for choosing suitable scanning tools, creating policies, and
								producing a baseline
								audit. The practical aspect of this unit was my Vulnerability Audit and Assessment
								assignment, which required
								me to assess the Gin and Juice website. I examined possible security vulnerabilities,
								identified relevant
								industry standards like GDPR, and noted areas of potential non-compliance. I also
								created a list of scanning
								and testing tools, justifying my choices, and proposed a realistic plan with
								recommendations prioritised
								by importance. This assignment accounts for 30% of the module grade and set the baseline
								for deeper analysis
								in future units.</p>

							<h4>So What?</h4>
							<p>This unit showed me how to connect theory to real-world practice. By conducting a
								baseline assessment of
								the Gin and Juice website, I gained valuable experience in analysing a live target and
								identifying
								realistic security challenges. I had to think critically about the assumptions and
								limitations of my chosen
								tools, as well as the potential operational impacts of running scans, such as scheduling
								out-of-hours
								scanning to minimise disruption. Structuring my findings clearly and concisely, with
								bullet points and
								tables, helped me stay within the word count while meeting the assignment requirements.
								This experience
								highlighted the importance of communicating technical findings in a way that a client
								can easily understand
								and act on.</p>

							<h4>Now What?</h4>
							<p>Moving forward, I will build on this experience by applying the baseline assessment
								approach to other
								projects, ensuring that I always link my analysis to appropriate industry standards. I
								also plan to expand
								my knowledge of scanning and testing tools, so I can better justify my choices in future
								reports. Producing
								clear timelines, listing assumptions and limitations, and presenting findings succinctly
								will be practices
								I carry into future vulnerability audits. This unit has shown me that setting a strong
								foundation with
								a well-documented baseline makes future in-depth testing and mitigation planning far
								more effective.
								Overall, this assignment reinforced my understanding of how to deliver a professional
								and valuable security
								assessment to a real client.</p>

							<p>Reflecting on my experience in Unit 4 of the Network Security module, I will use the
								Rolfe et al. (2001)
								reflective model to structure my thoughts and learning points.</p>

							<h4>What?</h4>
							<p>This unit focused on analysing security breaches and formulating mitigation strategies
								using practical tools.
								I reviewed several typical security breaches to understand how attackers gain access,
								escalate privileges,
								and exploit vulnerabilities. The readings and activities highlighted the legal and
								ethical implications of
								breaches, including important points raised by Schwartz and Janger (2007) about
								organisations’ legal duties.
								A key practical component was exploring the Kali Linux distribution and its wide range
								of tools designed for
								security testing, penetration testing, and forensic analysis. Bhatt (2018) provided an
								overview of the most
								commonly used tools and their purposes, which I found useful for planning real-world
								security assessments.</p>

							<h4>So What?</h4>
							<p>This unit helped me connect the dots between theory and practice by showing how breaches
								are analysed in
								professional contexts. By studying real breaches, I understood how important it is to
								plan mitigations for
								each stage of an attack, from prevention to response and recovery. Working with Kali
								Linux introduced me to
								industry-standard tools and made me realise how vital it is to choose the right tool for
								each stage of an
								assessment. I also learned that simply having access to tools is not enough — using them
								responsibly and
								ethically, while considering legal implications, is critical for professional practice.
							</p>

							<h4>Now What?</h4>
							<p>Moving forward, I will expand my familiarity with the different tools in Kali Linux and
								practice applying
								them in realistic scenarios. I plan to build on this by using the tools to perform
								deeper breach analysis
								and mitigation planning in future units and projects. I will also pay close attention to
								the legal and ethical
								aspects of breach analysis, ensuring that any recommendations I make in my work are not
								only technically sound
								but also compliant with relevant laws and regulations. This unit has strengthened my
								ability to describe breach
								attacks, select appropriate mitigation strategies, and confidently use specialist tools
								to assess and respond
								to threats.</p>

							<h3 class="major">REFLECTION</h3>
							<p>Reflecting on my experience in Unit 5 of the Network Security module, I will use the
								Rolfe et al. (2001)
								reflective model to organise my thoughts and learning outcomes.</p>

							<h4>What?</h4>
							<p>In this unit, I explored the role of logging and forensics in breach investigation and
								resolution. The
								lecturecast explained why logging is crucial for detecting, investigating, and
								responding to security
								incidents. I learned about logging configurations for both Windows and Linux systems,
								and how best
								practice differs across platforms. The unit also introduced common forensic tools and
								techniques, helping
								me understand what kind of evidence can be collected and analysed to identify the source
								and impact of a
								breach. The reading from Hertzog et al. (2017) provided practical advice on working with
								Kali Linux and
								reinforced my understanding of how logging and forensics fit into broader security
								assessments. I also
								reviewed a vulnerability assessment reporting template, which helped me link forensic
								findings back to
								reporting and documentation best practices.</p>

							<h4>So What?</h4>
							<p>This unit showed me how logging and forensic analysis provide the backbone for incident
								response.
								Understanding what to log, how to configure logs, and how to interpret them helps
								security professionals
								detect suspicious activity early. I also realised that forensic tools play a critical
								role in providing
								concrete evidence of an attack’s timeline, scope, and impact. The practical activity of
								reviewing the
								assessment reporting template helped me see how to translate technical findings into
								clear, actionable
								recommendations for clients or stakeholders. This unit tied together technical
								configuration skills with
								the need for clear communication and documentation, which is vital for legal and
								organisational follow-up
								after a breach.</p>

							<h4>Now What?</h4>
							<p>Going forward, I plan to build on this knowledge by practising how to configure logging
								systems for
								different environments and by testing various forensic tools on sample scenarios. I will
								focus on refining
								my ability to analyse log data and translate it into meaningful evidence. This includes
								understanding how
								security features like encryption or access controls can affect log interpretation. I
								also plan to develop
								my skills in creating clear, comprehensive reports that present forensic findings and
								mitigation steps
								effectively. This unit has strengthened my understanding of how logging and forensics
								support the full
								lifecycle of network security — from prevention to investigation and response.</p>
