							<h3 class="major">REFLECTION</h3>
							<p>Reflecting on my experience in the Secure Software Development module, I will utilize the
								Rolfe et al. (2001) reflective model to structure my thoughts and insights.</p>

							<h4>What?</h4>
							<p>The module introduced me to crucial concepts in secure software development, particularly
								contrasting traditional methodologies like the waterfall model with modern agile
								approaches. I learned about the importance of flexibility in responding to changing
								requirements, especially regarding security considerations. The use of the Unified
								Modelling Language (UML) in our projects helped me visualize and decompose tasks
								effectively, creating flowcharts that mapped out software processes. This practical
								application was instrumental in understanding the design phase of software development.
								Additionally, the module emphasized fostering a risk-aware culture, highlighting that
								security is not just a technical issue but also a human one.</p>

							<h4>So What?</h4>
							<p>Participating in a development team allowed me to experience various roles, from coding
								to security testing. Allocating work effectively among team members was essential for
								maintaining progress and meeting deadlines. I found that taking on different
								responsibilities, such as developing secure APIs and conducting code reviews, enhanced
								my understanding of secure coding practices and how security can be integrated into each
								stage of the development lifecycle. Team meetings were vital for collaboration; they
								provided a platform to discuss challenges and share insights, reinforcing the need for
								open communication and collective problem-solving.</p>

							<h4>Now What?</h4>
							<p>Moving forward, I plan to implement the lessons learned in future projects. Emphasizing
								security from the outset, I will advocate for agile methodologies that allow for ongoing
								adaptation to security threats. I aim to integrate risk management into my workflow,
								ensuring that my future teams maintain a culture of security awareness. Moreover, I
								intend to further develop my skills in UML to improve my ability to model software
								deployments effectively. This module has solidified my understanding that secure
								software development is a continuous process that thrives on collaboration,
								adaptability, and a proactive security mindset.</p>

						<h3 class="major">UML Modelling to Support Secure System Planning</h3>
						<p>Welcome to Week 2, during which we will gain some practical skills regarding the creation of

								model
								to capture my thoughts.</p>

							<h4>What?</h4>
							<p>This unit deepened my understanding of how UML flow charts can facilitate communication
								among
								stakeholders during the software development lifecycle (SDLC). I learned to create these
								charts to represent processes clearly, which is essential for planning secure systems.
								Additionally, I recognized the importance of integrating security practices throughout
								the
								agile SDLC, rather than treating them as an afterthought.</p>

							<h4>So What?</h4>
							<p>Participating in hands-on activities to create UML models allowed me to apply theoretical
								concepts in a practical context. Collaborating with my peers to identify potential
								security
								weaknesses in software encouraged critical thinking and collective problem-solving. This
								collaborative experience highlighted the value of teamwork in developing secure software
								solutions and reinforced my understanding of security issues that can arise at various
								stages of development.</p>

							<h4>Now What?</h4>
							<p>Looking ahead, I plan to incorporate UML modeling techniques in my future projects to
								enhance
								communication with stakeholders. I aim to ensure that security considerations are
								integrated
								into each phase of the SDLC, promoting a proactive approach to security. By continuing
								to
								develop my skills in UML and applying the insights gained from this unit, I hope to
								contribute to the creation of more secure software systems.</p>

						<h2 class="major">UNIT 3</h2>
						<h3 class="major">Programming Languages: History, Concepts & Design</h3>
						<p>Welcome to Week 3 where we will spend some time investigating programming languages – looking
							at the history, concepts, and design that led to the languages we have today. Programming
							languages are a fundamental concept in computer science – they are the primary tool used by
							computer scientists and developers to design, define, create, and implement the tools we use
							today.</p>

						<h3 class="major">LEARNING OUTCOMES</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Discuss different approaches to vulnerability testing and assessments, and select
								appropriate methods based on the target business.</li>
							<li>Utilise open-source scanning and testing tools to perform vulnerability assessments.
							</li>
							<li>Analyse assessment results and produce reports with recommendations to mitigate
								vulnerabilities.</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="more-content" style="display: none;">
							<h3 class="major">REFLECTION</h3>
							<p>Reflecting on my experiences in Unit 3, I will use the Rolfe et al. (2001) reflective
								model
								to capture my thoughts.</p>

							<h4>What?</h4>
							<p>This unit provided a comprehensive overview of the history and evolution of programming
								languages, highlighting key milestones and the impact of pioneers like Alan Turing and
								Alonzo Church. I gained insights into the fundamental concepts of programming, such as
								inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, and how these are implemented in Python. The
								exploration of best practices to address common security issues was particularly
								valuable,
								as it tied together language design with practical security considerations.</p>

							<h4>So What?</h4>
							<p>Understanding the historical context of programming languages helped me appreciate the
								design
								choices that influence modern languages. Learning about various paradigms and concepts
								reinforced the idea that programming is not just about syntax but also about the
								underlying
								principles that guide development. Discussions around security challenges and best
								practices
								opened my eyes to the importance of considering security at every stage of development,
								especially when choosing programming languages and frameworks.</p>

							<h4>Now What?</h4>
							<p>Moving forward, I plan to apply the concepts learned in this unit to my coding practices.
								I
								aim to use design patterns effectively in future projects, understanding when and why to
								implement them for improved security and functionality. Additionally, I will continue to
								stay informed about the history and evolution of programming languages, as this
								knowledge
								will enhance my ability to choose the right tools for specific challenges. This unit has
								equipped me with a deeper understanding of programming languages, empowering me to
								develop
								more secure and efficient software solutions.</p>

							<h3 class="major">REFLECTION</h3>
							<p>Reflecting on Unit 4, I explored two key concepts—regular expressions and recursion—and
								their
								effect on system security.</p>

							<h4>What?</h4>
							<p>This unit taught me how regular expressions streamline data validation but also pose
								risks
								like ReDoS attacks. I learned how recursion is useful for solving complex problems but
								can
								lead to performance and stack overflow issues if not implemented properly.</p>

							<h4>So What?</h4>
							<p>Understanding these concepts allowed me to critically evaluate their use in secure
								programming. I realized that both techniques need careful consideration of security
								implications, especially when optimizing for performance and safety.</p>

							<h4>Now What?</h4>
							<p>Moving forward, I will focus on balancing functionality with security when using these
								techniques, ensuring regular expressions are optimized and recursion is well-implemented
								to
								prevent vulnerabilities.</p>
