                        combining traditional project management practices with software engineering principles. It

                            During Week 1, I was introduced to the multidisciplinary role of the
                            Software Engineering Project Manager. This unit explored the combination
                            of traditional project management practices, including planning,
                            estimation, and resource management, alongside core software engineering
                            principles. It also examined technical responsibilities such as
                            requirements engineering, agile project management, and collaborative
                            design, establishing a foundational understanding of how these disciplines
                            integrate within modern software development projects.

                            <p>
                                Reflecting on my learning in Unit 1: <em>Introduction to Software Engineering Project
                                    Management</em>, I apply the
                                Rolfe et al. (2021) reflective model to critically examine my understanding of Software
                                Engineering Project
                                Management (SEPM) and its relevance to contemporary software projects.
                            </p>

                            <h4>What?</h4>
                            <p>
                                This unit introduced the multidisciplinary role of the Software Engineering Project
                                Manager, distinguishing
                                traditional project management from SEPM. Key topics included the historical evolution
                                of both disciplines,
                                commonly used project management tools and certifications, and the relationship between
                                Project Management,
                                TOGAF, and the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Formative activities focused on
                                team formation, assessment
                                briefing, and establishing a group contract to support collaborative project delivery.
                            </p>

                            <h4>So What?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Critically, the unit demonstrated that traditional project management alone is
                                insufficient for software projects
                                characterised by uncertainty and evolving requirements. SEPM integrates technical
                                practices such as requirements
                                engineering and agile management with governance structures, reducing failure risks
                                identified in large-scale
                                projects (Sommerville, 2020; PMI, 2021; Kerzner, 2022).
                            </p>

                            <h4>Now What?</h4>
                            <p>
                                I will apply SEPM principles by critically evaluating SDLC choices, strengthening
                                requirements management, and
                                supporting transparent communication within my project team.

                        <p>During Week 2, I explored key aspects of project management, with a focus on
                            understanding why projects fail and how effective requirements gathering can
                            reduce the likelihood of failure. This unit examined real-world examples of
                            large-scale project failures, the underlying causes of these failures, and
                            appropriate mitigation strategies. Practical skills in requirements elicitation
                            were also developed through the use of the Gherkin tool.</p>

                                to at least two peers’ examples of project failures. These responses
                                analysed possible causes of failure and proposed appropriate mitigation
                                strategies. Each response was limited to 200–300 words and labelled as a

                            project managers, with a particular focus on estimating, planning, and
                            risk assessment. The unit explored how these tools support effective
                            decision-making and contribute to successful project delivery.
                            Emphasis was placed on understanding when and how to select appropriate
                            techniques for different project scenarios.

                                For the e-Portfolio activity, I read Wang et al. (2023) and reflected
                                on an online system that I use on a daily basis. I considered how
                                data structures might be used at the back-end of the system to
                                support functionality and performance. This reflection informed

                            During Week 4, I examined common risks associated with large-scale software
                            projects and explored approaches to risk evaluation and mitigation. This unit
                            also focused on the practical application of project estimation tools, building
                            on techniques introduced in earlier weeks. Through this, I developed an
                            understanding of how estimation and risk management support informed
                            decision-making within software engineering projects.

                                Cycle. I applied risk assessment frameworks introduced in Unit 3 to categorise
                                risks and proposed appropriate mitigation strategies. I also reviewed a peer’s
                                wiki entry and suggested an alternative mitigation approach.

                                The Unit 4 seminar focused on estimating tools and risk assessment techniques.
                                Seminar preparation involved applying estimation tools to a project scenario
                                and evaluating associated risks. Group discussions supported critical
                                reflection on the suitability and limitations of different estimation and
                                risk management approaches.

                                Seminar preparation consisted of two distinct activities. The first focused on
                                estimation, where I reviewed the NIST Privacy tools, implemented an estimation
                                method in Python using Jupyter Notebook, and produced an effort and time estimate
                                based on the system requirements. The second activity concentrated on risk
                                assessment, involving a critical review of risks identified by Verner et al.
                                (2014) and Anton and Nucu (2020), and the application of appropriate risk
                                categorisation frameworks discussed in Unit 3.

                            stakeholders influence and prioritise user experience, as well as the
                            critical role of the Project Manager in facilitating and managing UX

                            <p>
                                Reflecting on my learning in Unit 5: <em>User Experience</em>, I applied
                                the Rolfe et al. (2021) reflective model to examine the role of user
                                experience within software engineering projects and the responsibilities
                                of the Project Manager in supporting effective UX.
                            </p>

                            <h4>What?</h4>
                            <p>
                                This unit explored usability principles, stakeholder involvement in user
                                experience, and methods for monitoring and measuring UX across the project
                                lifecycle. It also examined how Test-driven Development in Python can
                                support improved user experience through higher software quality.
                            </p>

                            <h4>So What?</h4>
                            <p>
                                The unit demonstrated that user experience is a shared responsibility
                                requiring structured planning and continuous evaluation. Research
                                indicates that integrating UX into project management improves usability
                                and user satisfaction (Sommerville, 2020; ISO 9241-210, 2019). The use of
                                Test-driven Development and code quality tools further supports UX by
                                reducing defects and enhancing reliability (Beck, 2020).
                            </p>

                            <h4>Now What?</h4>
                            <p>
                                I will apply these insights by embedding UX considerations into project
                                planning and using test-driven practices to support continuous improvement.

                                I participated in Collaborative Discussion 2, which focused on factors
                                affecting user experience. This activity encouraged critical reflection
                                on how design decisions, stakeholder priorities, and development
                                practices influence the overall user experience of software systems.

                        <p>
                            During Week 6, I examined the principles of Test-driven Development (TDD)
                            using pytest in Python, alongside the role of user experience researchers
                            and the impact of stakeholder emotions on software projects. This unit
                            connected technical testing practices with broader user-centred and
                            emotional considerations in software engineering.

                                Formative learning focused on a practical Jupyter Notebook activity,
                                where I explored the use of pytest to support Test-driven Development.
                                This activity reinforced how early and automated testing can improve
                                software quality, reliability, and overall user experience.

                                The Unit 6 seminar focused on the relationship between user experience
                                and Test-driven Development. Seminar discussions reviewed responses
                                from the Unit 5 Collaborative Learning Discussion and provided an
                                opportunity to reflect on team progress for the development project.

                                Report. As part of the team, I contributed to requirements analysis,
                                methodology selection, project planning, and cost estimation, while
                                also completing an individual peer review to evaluate team

                        <p>
                            During Week 7, I examined how software development life cycles (SDLC) influence
                            project management, focusing on the waterfall and agile approaches. The unit
                            explored tasks carried out at each stage of a life cycle and the role of the
                            Project Manager in supporting these activities. Key considerations included balancing
                            the triple constraints, addressing non-functional requirements, and learning from
                            common project mistakes.

                                As part of Collaborative Discussion 2, I reviewed and responded to at least two
                                peers’ posts. Each response analysed their contributions regarding SDLC practices,
                                project management, and user experience, providing constructive feedback. Responses
                                were clearly labelled as <em>Peer Response</em> and demonstrated critical reflection
                                on their ideas and my own understanding.

                                and considering the emotional reactions of users. I also reflected on the impact of
                                these reactions when managing software projects, informed by multiple academic
                                sources. This preparation supported discussions on how Project Managers can proactively
                                manage stakeholder responses to optimise user experience and project success.

                                demonstrated my understanding of data storage and management in Python and informed
                                my practical implementation.

                                Seminar preparation focused on becoming familiar with data structures, which are
                                approaches to organise, store and manage electronic data. I reviewed python.org (n.d.)
                                and other relevant sources. I selected at least two different data structures to hold
                                the data associated with the functional and non-functional requirements defined for
                                Task 1, justifying my choices. I also sourced at least one academic paper, similar to
                                Abeykoon et al. (2020), to support my decisions. I prepared to share my chosen article,
                                list of requirements, and selected data structures during the seminar.
                                The session also allowed review of team progress.
